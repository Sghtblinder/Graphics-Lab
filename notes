ok. so we have a collection of source files with intertwining global variable
dependencies. i'm in the process of trying to convert them to angular modules.
i've gone through and found what variables are dependent between files, marked
them as such, and made a graph of what files depend on what. I am in the
process of finding a method by which to dis-connect them. I'd like to do a
complete overhaul, but I don't have that kind of time.

I've looked at angular module services, factories, and providers. still trying
to get in my head how the files interact.
